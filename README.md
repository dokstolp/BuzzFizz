# BuzzFizz
This is a repository containing a file for the Buzz/Fizz problem asked for my application to Swift Navigation. The problem consists of:

In the programming language of your choice, write a program generating the first n Fibonacci numbers F(n), printing

-"Buzz" when F(n) is divisible by 3.

-"Fizz" when F(n) is divisible by 5.

-"FizzBuzz" when F(n) is divisible by 15.

-"BuzzFizz" when F(n) is prime.

-the value F(n) otherwise.

We encourage you to compose your code for this question in a way that represents the quality of code you produce in the workplace - e.g. tests, documentation, linting, dependency management (though there's no need to go this far).

Please upload your code to GitHub or bitbucket and post a link to the repo or gist as your answer in the Lever form.
